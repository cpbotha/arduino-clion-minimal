#+TITLE: Minimal barebones CLion Arduino example

This is a minimal example, built around the blink sketch, that
demonstrates how to work on your arduino sketches using CLion using no
additional software.

Tested with CLion 2017.3.1 and Arduino 1.8.5 on Uno and M0.

See the [[https://vxlabs.com/2018/03/24/developing-arduino-sketches-with-jetbrains-clion-a-minimal-example/][explanatory blog post]] for more details.

* Alternatives

- Visual Studio Code with [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-arduino][the Arduino extension]] is amazing and works
  out of the box.
- PlatformIO CLion integration:
